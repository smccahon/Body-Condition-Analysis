This file serves as supportive documentation to Shelby McCahon's neonicotinoid body condition analysis. 

Date created: 2024-10-28

-------------------------

Objective: Determine if neonicotinoid concentrations and detections influence shorebird body condition. We are assessing detections (yes or no) as an explanatory variable due to the rapid metabolism of neonicotinoids. 

Body condition response variables: body mass, size corrected body mass, fat, pectoral muscle size, pectoral muscle score, scaled mass index, fattening index (metabolite data)

Explanatory variables of interest: neonicotinoid detection (yes or no), neonicotinoid concentration (ug/L)

Controlling variables: sex, year, Julian date (if non-migratory species), date into migration season (if migratory species), season (spring/fall), species (random effect)
